I built an AI to run my life. 

Think of it like JARVIS — an operating system for my biological "suit". 

I call it LifeOS. It's not fully autonomous, but it does pre-commit rules and rituals with a system that holds state when I'm tired.

## Hitting The Wall

I'm the founder of a deep tech company. For four years I lived inside slips, resets, and morale management through timelines that kept not arriving. Fifteen people's livelihoods depending on my decisions.

Four years of accumulated variance finally exceeded my capacity to absorb it.

---

Nights became compulsive. Refreshing. Checking. Tweaking. Running scenarios. At 1am, replaying the same interaction, rewriting the same slide.

I was self-soothing with control. Buying temporary relief with tomorrow's cognition.

It didn't feel optional—when you're the person holding the system together, stopping feels like betrayal. But your body doesn't care about loyalty.

---

August 2025. HRV in the 30s. Resting heart rate in the 80s and 90s. Deep sleep basically gone. I have ADHD, and my nervous system became so dysregulated I couldn't tolerate my meds.

Four months of trying to recover. More effort. More planning. More discipline. Nothing held.

Because I was trying to solve a nervous system problem with the tool that was compromised: cognition.

**So I built a governor.**

## I. The Governor

A rules engine for a human life.

LifeOS reads objective inputs—sleep, HRV, calendar density—chooses a mode, and enforces constraints when my judgment is degraded.

<Callout type="info">

**Build:** Ship primary artifacts. Accept controlled stress.

**Maintain:** Protect momentum. Reduce scope. Close loops.

**Recover:** Minimum viable output. Maximal sleep. No intensity.

</Callout>

*Chosen from capacity + obligations. Not ambition.*

The system tracks seven pillars: Health, Training, Capital, Learning, Relationships, Output, and Integrity. Each has its own status, thresholds, and rules. Health always wins conflicts with other pillars. If the body breaks, nothing else matters.

The point isn't productivity. It's alignment—living every day in accordance with my mission and values, even when my nervous system is fighting me.

A year ago, building something like this required a team. I built it with Claude, Python, a few JSON files, and a Garmin watch.

**That's the stack. That's the whole trick.**

<Callout type="info">

**LifeOS is:**
- A constraint engine for bad states
- An incident-response system for the self
- A continuity layer across weeks

**LifeOS is not:**
- Therapy
- Motivation
- A personality replacement
- A substitute for rest or relationships

</Callout>

## II. The Interface

Four commands. Each syncs fresh data and launches the AI with context.

```bash
lifeos-morning      # Morning calibration
lifeos-evening      # Evening shutdown
lifeos-checkin      # Quick status check
lifeos-weekly       # Sunday integrity review
```

A typical morning session returns something like:

<Callout type="highlight">

**Mode:** Maintain

**Top 3:** Finish essay draft, visa follow-up, evening gym

**Hard stop:** Shutdown at 9:30pm

**Open loops:** 2 (Greg gaming, apartment leads)

</Callout>

Some parts are scripted, some are manual review. The key is the ritual: state, assess, intervene, every time.

Each session starts by reading the constitution—a file that encodes everything the system needs to know.

<Callout type="info">

**Prime Directive**

Protect long-term trajectory against drift. Ensure every week moves toward the mission. Surface friction early. Close loops ruthlessly.

</Callout>

When I start a session, the AI knows my constraints, my current state, my open loops, and what I committed to.

**The session starts where the last one ended.**

## III. The Rules

Every rule has three parts: **signal → constraint → enforcement.**

When the signal appears, the rule fires. This is runtime, not philosophy.

<Callout type="highlight">

**TRAJECTORY — "Kill the side quest"**

Activates when: excited by a new idea, not on the scoreboard, "researching" instead of shipping, running 3+ parallel threads in one day.

*If it's not on the scoreboard, it doesn't get time.*

**INTEGRITY — "Name it or drop it"**

Activates when: resentment appears, replaying a conversation, withholding to "keep things smooth."

*Name it within 72 hours, or drop it.*

**DURABILITY — "Pay the debt first"**

Activates when: past 9pm and feeling urgency, chasing certainty (checking, tweaking, refreshing), 2-of-5 debt indicators fire.

*After 9pm: no decisions.*

</Callout>

The debt indicators come from my Garmin and my behaviour:

- Sleep quality down for 2+ nights
- HRV trending down or RHR trending up
- Racing thoughts after 9pm
- Compulsive checking or "one more thing"
- Emotional volatility (irritation, despair, overconfidence)

Any two of these fire DURABILITY. The rule is automatic.

## IV. Continuity

State persists in JSON. The AI reads it at session start:

```json
{
  "mode": "Maintain",
  "health": "GREEN",
  "hardStop": "Shutdown 21:30",
  "openLoops": ["Greg gaming", "Arabic classes"]
}
```

Continuity is maintained through handoffs. The session starts where the last one ended.

## V. Capture

I don't use a task manager. No kanban boards. No spec cards. No categories.

I write a stream of consciousness into a journal. The system extracts what matters.

A recent entry:

<Callout type="highlight">

*Ok, 6:59pm on Thursday. The final item is reviewing socials, feeling satisfied. Productive, making progress. Just take small steps every day. Systems are scaling well, starting to get into a rhythm. Oh, still need to sort my visa out. Hopefully, Reem can help with that. Generated my assessment for Heidi to review. I've got 30 days, so it's pretty urgent.*

</Callout>

The system reads this and extracts:
- **Open loop:** Visa situation. 30-day deadline
- **Follow-up:** Reem. Visa assistance
- **Completed:** Assessment for Heidi

I didn't file anything. I didn't tag anything. I just wrote what was on my mind. The extraction is automatic.

**Capture became cheap. That's why it actually happens.**

Week one: 3 entries. Week three: 16. Friction disappeared, so truth started showing up.

## VI. The System in Practice

Friday evening. I've just finished an 84-minute outdoor run—12.6km, first proper outdoor session in months. I feel good. I want to train hard again tomorrow.

The system checks my state. Body Battery: 11 out of 100. Training Readiness: 42. I'd drained 72 points of capacity in a single day.

The rule fires: recovery day tomorrow.

I wanted to push. But past-me knew this pattern. Feeling good after a hard effort doesn't mean you have recovered. The debt is invisible until you try to spend what isn't there.

I took the rest day. Two days later, Training Readiness was back to 88.

**The system didn't stop me from training. It stopped me from undoing the training.**

Evening session. The system has already pulled my messages and identified loose ends: a friend I said I'd game with this weekend (no time confirmed), apartment leads I'd messaged but not followed up.

It drafts a message with three game options and a proposed time. It creates a calendar event. It queues follow-ups to the apartment contacts. I review, edit, and hit send.

Five loops close in three minutes. Conversations that would have drifted. Commitments that would have become broken promises.

---

It doesn't work perfectly. Sometimes I override it. Sometimes I bargain with it.

A few weeks ago, I pushed through a low Training Readiness day because I "felt fine." It took four days to recover instead of one. The following week, I added a rule: Training Readiness below 40 means easy effort only. No exceptions.

The system catches me earlier. The recovery loop is shorter. I still relapse into old patterns. The difference is I catch it in hours, not weeks.

**And when I fail, I add a rule.**

## VII. Four Months Later

Four months of biometric data. The numbers aren't the point. The pattern is.

<DataInsight
  insight="Resting heart rate: 57 → 49"
  context="8 beats per minute in 4 months. Already down from the 80s-90s at the low point."
/>

<DataInsight
  insight="HRV: 68 → 79"
  context="Heart rate variability. Up from the 30s at the low point. Still climbing."
/>

<DataInsight
  insight="Hypersomnia: 14-16h → normal 7-8h"
  context="Dysregulation caused excessive sleep. Less is better here."
/>

<DataInsight
  insight="Deep sleep: 23 → 66 minutes"
  context="Nearly tripled. From barely registering to consistently restorative."
/>

*(Garmin data, October 2025 to January 2026. Directional signals, not medical measurements.)*

The system didn't heal me. I trained, slept more, reduced stress, and changed my environment. But LifeOS made those behaviours inevitable. It prevented me from sabotaging the recovery.

Four months ago, I couldn't run. I couldn't think clearly. I was surviving, not living.

Now I'm training for a 100km ultramarathon—600+ minutes of training per week. I've executed an international relocation. I wake up excited about my work again. My mission feels closer, not further away.

**Not through heroic effort. Through systems.**

## VIII. Dependence

<PullQuote>

When you're dysregulated, you're not the CEO. You're the incident.

</PullQuote>

This isn't outsourcing agency. It's locking in the decisions I made while sane.

The rules don't disappear if the system goes down. I internalise them through repetition. The AI is training wheels that become muscle memory.

## IX. What Remains

LifeOS doesn't cure depression. It doesn't replace therapy, sleep, or relationships.

It just prevents irreversible decisions while compromised.

## X. The Hard Stops

These are the hard stops. Written into the system.

<Callout type="info">

**Shutdown Enforcement:** No new work after shutdown. If something is undone at shutdown, it becomes a backlog item for tomorrow—never a night rescue. "Just one more thing" is not permitted.

**Friction Budget:** If friction score hits 3 or higher (sleep disruption + admin load + conflict + travel + injury), operate in Maintenance Mode. No expansion in any pillar.

**Debt Repayment:** Any two of five debt indicators fire → 24 hours minimum repayment before intensity returns. A coffee and a walk are not repayment.

**9pm Curfew:** After 9pm—no decisions, no strategy, no relationship processing. Write it down, close the laptop, sleep.

</Callout>

Everything else is negotiable.

## XI. The Access Shift

None of this was blocked by technology.

It was blocked by the willingness to treat your own life like something worth designing.

A year ago, personal governance required a team. Now it's a file, a watch, and a few evenings of setup.

<DataInsight
  insight="Personal governance is now cheap."
  context="The bottleneck is deciding you're worth the engineering."
/>

<SummaryBox title="Build Your Own">

Write 3 hard stops. Define 5 triggers. Pick 3 rituals. Add enforcement.

**Constraints + Triggers + Cadence + Enforcement.**

</SummaryBox>

Without it, I would have kept making midnight decisions from a compromised state and paid for them the next day.

The tools now exist for anyone to build personal governance: a few rules, a few triggers, a few rituals, enforced by something that doesn't negotiate when you're tired.

The Age of Wonders isn't only energy and materials. It's access to the infrastructure of a well-lived life. That infrastructure used to require money, teams, or exceptional self-control. Now it's cheap enough to build in a weekend.

**Motivation is weather. Systems are law.**
