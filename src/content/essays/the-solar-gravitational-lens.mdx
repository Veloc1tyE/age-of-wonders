## Draft Structure

### I. The Sun as a Lens

**Intuitive explanation:**
- Gravity bends light (Einstein, 1915)
- Every star is a gravitational lens
- The Sun focuses light at ~550 AU (focal line)
- This is not theory—it's settled physics

**Key analogy:** The Sun acts like a magnifying glass the size of a star.

### II. What SGL Can See

**The scale jump:**
- Current exoplanet observation: single pixels, spectra
- SGL capability: ~10 km resolution at 100 light-years
- **You can see continents. Oceans. Ice caps. Cloud patterns.**

<DataInsight 
  insight="SGL could resolve features as small as 10 km on an exoplanet 100 light-years away."
  context="That's the difference between knowing a planet exists and seeing its geography."
/>

**What becomes possible:**
- Biosignature detection (chlorophyll, oxygen, methane)
- Geological mapping (plate tectonics, volcanism)
- Weather systems (atmospheric circulation)
- Seasonal changes (vegetation cycles)

### III. The Technical Challenge (and Why It's Solvable)

**Challenges:**
1. Getting to 550 AU (Voyager took 45 years, but with Starship + nuclear propulsion: ~15-25 years)
2. Staying aligned (precision station-keeping)
3. Reconstructing images (computational challenge, not physical)
4. Pointing at target star (orbital mechanics)

**Why this is infrastructure, not miracle:**
- Propulsion: nuclear electric (already demonstrated)
- Alignment: ion thrusters (tested technology)
- Reconstruction: AI + massive compute (improving exponentially)
- Launch: Starship makes it affordable

### IV. The Epistemological Shift

**This is not astronomy. This is cartography.**

<PullQuote>

The Age of Exploration didn't begin when ships were built. It began when maps became possible.

</PullQuote>

**SGL creates:**
- A map of the galaxy
- Without visiting it
- Without disturbing it
- Just by looking

**Emotional arc:**
```
We once guessed    (pre-telescopes)
Then we inferred   (Hubble, spectroscopy)
Now we can see     (SGL: geography, biology)
```

### V. What This Changes

**Exploration decouples from colonization:**
- You can study a world without going there
- You can detect life without contact
- You can prioritize missions with actual knowledge

**Science becomes democratic:**
- Anyone can request telescope time
- Data is public
- Exoplanet geography becomes a field

**The galaxy becomes knowable:**
- Within 100 years, we could map thousands of worlds
- Resolution improves with baseline (multiple SGL telescopes)
- The unknown shrinks faster than we can explore

### VI. The Age of Wonders Is Here

**Close with:**
- SGL removes ignorance of *where*
- Physics permits this today
- The constraint is infrastructure, not knowledge
- What remains is *how* to move—and abundance is solving that too (setup for Free Starship)

## Notes for Development

**Tone:** This should feel like Galileo + Hubble + Google Maps had a child.

**Key emphasis:**
- Non-invasive exploration
- Perception without presence
- Knowledge without conquest

**Citations needed:**
- Turyshev et al. (SGL mission design papers)
- Einstein lens equations
- Current propulsion capabilities
- Image reconstruction algorithms

**Connections:**
- Payoff for Essay 2's "indexed universe" theme
- Proves "distance ≠ barrier to knowledge"
- Sets up Essay 7's "now let's move" argument
