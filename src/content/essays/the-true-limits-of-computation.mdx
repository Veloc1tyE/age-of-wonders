## Draft Structure

### I. The Landauer Limit (And Why It's Not the Real Limit)

**Set the stage:**
- Landauer: minimum energy to erase 1 bit = kT ln(2)
- At room temp: ~3 × 10^-21 joules per bit
- Often cited as "the fundamental limit"
- **But:** This assumes *irreversible* computation

**Key insight:** The limit is erasure, not computation itself.

### II. Reversible Computing

**The escape hatch:**
- Reversible logic gates (Toffoli, Fredkin)
- No information erasure → no minimum energy cost
- Theoretically: arbitrary computation with arbitrarily low energy
- Practically: still orders of magnitude better than current chips

<DataInsight 
  insight="Reversible computing could reduce energy per operation by 1000-10000x below current chips."
  context="The Landauer limit is not the limit. Irreversibility is."
/>

### III. Spatial Computing (Computing With Space, Not Just Time)

**Underexplored paradigm:**
- Current computing: time-serial (clock cycles)
- Alternative: spatial parallelism (analog, optical, quantum)
- Wave-based computing (photonics, acoustics)
- Molecular computing (DNA, chemical reactions)

**Key point:** When computation happens in space rather than time, different limits apply.

### IV. Cosmic Computation (Scale Changes Everything)

**What happens at planetary scale?**
- Matrioshka brains (hypothetical but physically plausible)
- Brown dwarfs as heat sinks
- Dyson swarms as compute substrates
- Jupiter-mass computers (theoretical upper bounds)

**Emphasis:** These aren't predictions. They're ceilings on what physics permits.

### V. The Real Constraint Is Heat, Not Energy

**The actual bottleneck:**
- Entropy increases (second law)
- Heat must be radiated
- Surface area limits dissipation
- Structure determines cooling efficiency

**But:** Even this allows for *enormous* computation.

### VI. What This Means for Civilization

<PullQuote>

The universe is not stingy with computation. We've barely begun to approach the ceiling.

</PullQuote>

**Practical implications:**
- AI scaling has room to run (decades, not years)
- Simulation fidelity will keep improving
- Molecular design becomes tractable
- Climate modeling, fusion optimization, drug discovery all accelerate

**Setup for Essay 5:** Computation unlocks material design. And material design unlocks everything.

## Notes for Development

**Tone:** Technical but accessible. Show that "limits" are often "current implementation details."

**Key emphasis:**
- Landauer ≠ practical limit
- Reversible computing is real
- Heat dissipation is the true constraint
- Even that allows immense scaling

**Citations needed:**
- Landauer's principle papers
- Reversible computing research (Bennett, etc.)
- Photonic/optical computing advances
- Matrioshka brain calculations (theoretical)

**Connections:**
- Grounds the optimism of Essay 1 in physics
- Enables Essay 5's "design materials from first principles"
- Shows that intelligence scaling is far from over
