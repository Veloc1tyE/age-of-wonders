<SiteLayout title="About — Age of Wonders">
  <h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 32px;">About</h1>
  
  <p>
    Age of Wonders is a body of writing and creative work exploring a simple belief system
  </p>

  <ol style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 30px; font-size:20px;">
    <li>The universe is abundant beyond our wildest dreams.</li>
    <li>We can create a future of wonders.</li>
    <li>Access is everything.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Why Energy Matters</h2>
  
  <p>
    Energy access is the single most significant determinant of living standards. It changes how societies think and behave. When energy is scarce, people are forced into short-term trade-offs. Conflict is easier to justify. Suffering is rationalized as unavoidable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When energy becomes abundant, those pressures ease. Quality of life improves, creativity expands, and it becomes harder to justify cruelty or neglect. In that sense, material abundance enables moral expansion.
  </p>

  <h2>The Mission</h2>
  
  <p>
    My mission is to help move humanity toward a future of abundance by increasing access to opportunity, building enabling systems, and encouraging people to reach for the stars. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Age of Wonders mindset is about creating the conditions where humanity can lift its perspective beyond constant constraint and start asking bigger questions: who we are, what we value, and which future we want to build.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top:32px; font-style:italic;">
    The sky isn't the limit. It's an infinite canvas. An invitation to explore, to create, and to build things worthy of an Age of Wonders.
